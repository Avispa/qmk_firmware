# Wasp's Layout

My ErgoDox Infinity keymap. Don't know if it matters, but using it with a upper tilt in the center of roughly estimated 5-10%. By coincidence it is the tilt that the height of a RaspberryPI box creates. ;) Switches are CherryMX blues with rubber rings; even though I regret I didn't buy Gaterons -- just by reviews I saw later.

## Features
* 3 layouts:
  * Qwertz layout.
  * K.A,Y layout.
  * Starcraft Broodwar layout.
* QWERTZ and K.A,Y layout with number raw sorted even numbers to the right and uneven numbers to the left half while increasing the size of the numbers from the inside to the outside.
* Mod keys on the index fingers with tab toggle but still experimenting with it so it doesn't infect fast typing negatively to much.
* Shift only on the left thumb. As well as Enter and ESC on the outer Thumb keys.

## Changelog:

#### 2017-06-08 CEST 15:41
* Swapped Q and F key for the moment.
* Swapped ALT and GUI key on both thumb clusters.
* Put Delete key also on the left hand side on the lowest raw to the most right. Let's see what I will favor.

### 2017-06-06:
* Switched F and Q key on K.A,Y layout.

#### 2017-04-09 CEST 03:17
* Replaced Tab with Esc
* Replaced F11 with momentary Fn layer (green, s. picture)
* Swapped X and ÃŸ (sz)
* Replaced upper BS doubled with Win/Gui
* Changed number row to 9 7 5 3 1 /  0 2 4 6 8
* Changed F-Keys accordingly

### 2016-02-xx:
* Removed ALT from V and M key again because it lead to too many unintended OS commands while fast typing.

### 2016-01-xx:
* Init layout on basis of algernon's layout but altered heavily. Only tap toggle functionality and the alted shift behaviour remained. Rest just for used as skeleton.
