# Wasp's Layout

My ErgoDox Infinity keymap. Don't know if it matters, but using it with a upper tilt in the center of roughly estimated 5-10%. By coincidence it is the tilt that the height of a RaspberryPI box creates. ;) Switches are CherryMX blues with rubber rings; even though I regret I didn't buy Gaterons -- just by reviews I saw later.

## Features
* 3 layouts:
  * Qwertz layout.
  * K.A,Y layout.
  * Starcraft Broodwar layout.
* QWERTZ and K.A,Y layout with number raw sorted even numbers to the right and uneven numbers to the left half while increasing the size of the numbers from the inside to the outside.
* Mod keys on the index fingers with tab toggle but still experimenting with it so it doesn't infect fast typing negatively to much.
* Shift only on the left thumb. As well as Enter and ESC on the outer Thumb keys.

## Changelog:

### 2017-06-06:

* Switched F and Q key on K.A,Y layout.

### 2016-02-xx:

* Removed ALT from V and M key again because it lead to too many unintended OS commands while fast typing.

### 2016-01-xx:

* Init layout of basis of algernon's layout and altered heavily. Mainly just because of tap toggle functionality and the alted shift behaviour. Rest just skeleton.
